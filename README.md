# Bosh lastpass plugin

Short description.

## What is BOSH?
BOSH orchestrates initial deployments and ongoing updates that are: predictable, repeatable, reliable, self-healing, infrastructure-agnostic. You can take a look on [BOSH project on GitHub](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh) and read more details in [docs](http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/bosh/).

## How to install
